						<br>
						<br>
						On behalf of Science Publishing Group, we would like to express our sincere thanks to you for your valuable contributions to our journals in the past year as an editorial board member. We are expecting a deep-level cooperation with you now.
						<br>
						<br>
						We are planning to publish a series of books in 2014. We accept both whole books and book chapters. By publishing with us, you will enjoy 100% royalties from sold books deducting from prime cost. You can publish a whole book with us or a book chapter.
						<br>
						<br>
						Besides, we would like to ask you to propose a book title that interests you in your research fields and you can write one or more chapters of the book. We will invite other authors to join you to finish the rest chapters of the book you proposed. You would have a chance to be the Editor-in-Chief of the Book. As an Editor-in-Chief, you can publish your book chapter(s) in this book free of charge. </td>
